 ## partials are the common parts of the website which we want to show on each page of our website like 
### for example we want to show a same section of header or footer on each page of our webites that is about section ,help section , main page
 

so, partials is actually not a complete webpage 

  *But its just a section of the whole website so we do not write the code whole from the scratch that says from DOCTYPE*
 
 
 ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>Document</title>
 </head>
 <body>
     
 </body>
 </html>  --}}

 ```
